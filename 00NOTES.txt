Notes from 'working meeting'

I went through the slides with Lydia, Linda, Eneida, and Ilene in a
'working meeting'

They seemed to think that it all looked good and that the vadr part of
the presentation would be the bulk of it.

We will have another meeting Oct 15 or 16 where we will go through the
slides.

TODO:
- update slides to use SARS-CoV-2 instead of Dengue, even though
  feedback was that I could leave them as Dengue
- Spruce up first slides so that not all text
- Send either PDF of powerpoint to Lydia by early next week

============================

From 3/6/20 email to Linda and Ilene
and then further analysis:

2. MT123292 
   5' end: NEW: positions 2..23 do not match RefSeq but are a nearly
   identical duplication of positions 27697-27719 (off by a single
   extra U) 
   3' end: Final 35nt are a duplicate of positions 15316..15350.
 
----------------

5. MT123292: fails with DUPLICATE_REGIONS, LOW_SIMILARITY_START and
   LOW_SIMILARITY errors. The final 35 nt are a duplicate of NC_045512
   positions 15316..15350, and the 5' end has extra sequence.
