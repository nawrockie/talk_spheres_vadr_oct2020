Notes from 'working meeting'

I went through the slides with Lydia, Linda, Eneida, and Ilene in a
'working meeting'

They seemed to think that it all looked good and that the vadr part of
the presentation would be the bulk of it.

We will have another meeting Oct 15 or 16 where we will go through the
slides.

TODO:
- update slides to use SARS-CoV-2 instead of Dengue, even though
  feedback was that I could leave them as Dengue
- Spruce up first slides so that not all text
- Send either PDF of powerpoint to Lydia by early next week
