\item Currently in testing for COX1: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Started with 9000 vetted COX1 protein sequences (Susan Schafer)
  \item Split based on taxonomy and aligned with MUSCLE
  \item Derived 43 \textcolor{red}{\emph{alignment-based}} models (e.g. \emph{Porifera}, \emph{Amphibia}) covering 5 genetic codes
  \item Classification stage compares against 43 models
  \item Protein validation stage compares against 9000 proteins
